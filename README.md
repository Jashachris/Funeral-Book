## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=12, recommended: >=18)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jashachris/Funeral-Book.git
cd Funeral-Book
npm install
```

2. Seed the database with sample data (optional):

```bash
npm run seed
```

This creates sample records, a demo user, and a test post in `data.json`.

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Development Environment Configuration

#### Local File Uploads
The application uses a local `uploads/` directory for file storage in development:
- Upload directory: `/uploads` (automatically created)
- Files uploaded through the API are stored locally
- The `uploads/` directory is git-ignored to prevent committing large files

#### Debug Email/SMTP
In development, emails are **not sent** but are logged to a local file:
- Email log file: `email-debug.log`
- All email attempts are captured with timestamp, recipient, subject, and body
- Use the `emailLogger` module: `require('./lib/emailLogger').logEmail({ to, subject, body })`
- The log file is git-ignored

Example usage:
```javascript
const { logEmail } = require('./lib/emailLogger');

logEmail({
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome to Funeral Book',
  body: 'Thank you for joining...'
});
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` â€” Start the development server
- `npm test` â€” Run tests
- `npm run seed` â€” Populate database with sample data
- `npm run lint` â€” Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run lint:fix` â€” Auto-fix ESLint issues
- `npm run format` â€” Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` â€” Check if code is formatted correctly
- `npm run share` â€” Start and expose the app globally (ngrok/localtunnel)

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Tests will:
- Reset the database
- Test user registration and login
- Test record CRUD operations
- Verify API endpoints

### Code Quality

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting:

```bash
# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format all code
npm run format

# Check formatting
npm run format:check
```

Files added in this scaffold:

- `server.js` â€” simple HTTP server with API and static file serving
- `public/` â€” frontend files (index.html, app.js, style.css)
- `data.json` â€” simple file-backed JSON database (ignored by git)
- `test/test.js` â€” basic API tests

Notes

This scaffold intentionally avoids external dependencies for simplicity. It's suitable for local demos and as a starting point.

API

### Records (Memorials)
- GET /api/records â€” list all records
- GET /api/records/:id â€” get a single record by id
- POST /api/records â€” create a record (JSON body, { name, note? })
- PUT /api/records/:id â€” update fields (JSON body, { name?, note? })
- DELETE /api/records/:id â€” delete a record

### Media Uploads for Memorials
- POST /api/records/:id/media â€” upload a media file for a memorial (multipart/form-data)
- GET /api/records/:id/media â€” get all media files for a memorial

Example upload:
```bash
# Upload a photo to memorial with ID 1
curl -X POST -F "file=@photo.jpg" http://localhost:3000/api/records/1/media

# Get all media for memorial with ID 1
curl http://localhost:3000/api/records/1/media
```

Moderation & privacy

- Registration supports public or private accounts. When creating a user you can include the optional `private` boolean in the register payload. Example:

```bash
# create a private account
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"username":"alice","password":"secret","private":true}' \
	http://localhost:3000/api/users
```

- Blocking users

	- POST /api/users/block â€” authenticated. JSON body: { "targetId": 123 }
		- Returns: { "blocked": true }
	- POST /api/users/unblock â€” authenticated. JSON body: { "targetId": 123 }
		- Returns: { "blocked": false }

	Example (block user id 2):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
	-d '{"targetId":2}' http://localhost:3000/api/users/block
```

- Reporting abusive users

	- POST /api/report â€” authenticated. JSON body: { "targetUserId": 123, "categories": ["harassment","sexism"], "detail": "optional text" }
		- Allowed categories: harassment, bullying, sexism, racism, derogatory, hate
		- Returns: { "reported": true, "id": <reportId> }

Share the app globally

If you want to let people worldwide access a local development instance quickly, there's a simple command added:

```bash
# start and expose the app (uses ngrok if NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN set, otherwise localtunnel via npx)
npm run share
```

Notes:
- `npm run share` will start the server (if not already running) and attempt to expose it using `npx ngrok` (preferred) or `npx localtunnel` as a fallback.
- To use ngrok without interactive login, set `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN` in your environment:

```bash
export NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
npm run share
```

If you prefer another tunnel provider I can add direct integrations (e.g., Cloudflare Tunnel, Serveo) or produce a Docker deployment for cloud hosting.
	Example:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
	-d '{"targetUserId":2,"categories":["harassment"],"detail":"Repeated insults"}' \
	http://localhost:3000/api/report
```

- How privacy and moderation are handled

	- Private accounts: posts created by users with `private: true` are only visible to the account owner (requests authenticated as that user). `GET /api/posts` will filter private users' posts unless you are the owner.
	- Blocking: a blocker record is stored in `data.json` under `blocks`. Currently blocking is recorded but only post visibility is impacted via the privacy model; enforcement in chat and other surfaces can be added later.
	- Reporting: reports are stored in `data.json` under `reports`. In production you'd forward reports to a moderation workflow, rate-limit submissions, and add admin endpoints for review.

Notes

- The moderation features are intentionally lightweight and stored in `data.json`. For production use consider moving reports and blocks to a proper database, adding rate limits, notification hooks for moderators, and stronger enforcement of blocks across chat and profile endpoints.

Docker

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t funeral-book .
docker run -p 3000:3000 funeral-book
```


Examples

Register / Login (placeholder endpoints â€” not implemented in scaffold yet):

```bash
# register (example)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"bob","password":"secret"}' http://localhost:3000/api/users/register

# login -> returns a token
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"bob","password":"secret"}' http://localhost:3000/api/users/login
```

Create a post (attach a video URL):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"In loving memory","body":"A short message","videoUrl":"https://..."}' http://localhost:3000/api/posts
```

Instant messaging (SSE client):

```bash
# Open a live SSE stream in terminal
curl http://localhost:3000/api/chat/stream

# Send a chat message
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user":"bob","message":"hello"}' http://localhost:3000/api/chat/send
```

Go live (get a stream key placeholder):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user":"bob"}' http://localhost:3000/api/live/start
```

Advanced features (implemented in scaffold)

- Tagging: posts accept a `tags` array and `mentions` array (usernames) in the POST body.
- Group chats: SSE chat supports a `room` query parameter. Examples:

	- Open room stream:
		curl "http://localhost:3000/api/chat/stream?room=grief-group-1"
	- Send to room:
		curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user":"bob","message":"hi group"}' "http://localhost:3000/api/chat/send?room=grief-group-1"

PWA & background music

- A simple `manifest.json` is included. You can add `music.mp3` at `/public/music.mp3` and users can toggle background music from the UI.

Mobile packaging to Play Store / App Store

- Packaging a web app for mobile stores typically requires a wrapper (e.g., Capacitor, Cordova, or a native shell). This scaffold is the web backend + frontend foundation. If you want, I can:
	- Create a Capacitor project and configure Android/iOS builds, or
	- Generate a Progressive Web App (PWA) build and provide guidance to publish to Play Store as a Trusted Web Activity (TWA).
