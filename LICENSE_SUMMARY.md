Summary of License Change

This repository was originally published under the MIT License. At the
direction of the Owners (Jashaad Gulifield and Christine Grant), the license
text in `LICENSE` has been replaced with a proprietary "All Rights Reserved"
notice. This change reflects the Owners' intent to retain exclusive rights to
the Software and to require express written licensing for any third-party use.

Important notes:
- The LICENSE file now states that no rights are granted except via a written
  license agreement signed by the Owners.
- If any third parties previously contributed code under the MIT License,
  additional contributor assignment or permission may be required to change
  the licensing for their contributions. Consult counsel before relying on the
  new license for previously contributed material.
- This summary is informational only and not legal advice.

Next steps recommended:
1. Collect signed inventor assignment and cover sheet in `patent/signed/`.
2. If third-party contributions exist, get contributor assignment/consent.
3. Prepare commercial license agreement and start outreach with counsel.
