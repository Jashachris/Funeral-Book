Filing Instructions and Checklist for a US Provisional Patent Application

Important: This is informational only and not legal advice. Consult a registered patent attorney or agent for filing and claim drafting.

Quick checklist
- [ ] Finalize provisional application description (use PROVISIONAL_DRAFT.md as base)
- [ ] Prepare any drawings (hand sketches are acceptable for provisional)
- [ ] Complete inventor assignment and signatures (INVENTOR_ASSIGNMENT.md)
- [ ] Create an account on the USPTO Patent Center (or use a registered attorney)
- [ ] Prepare Cover Sheet (Provisional Application Cover Sheet) listing inventors and correspondence address
- [ ] Pay provisional filing fee (see USPTO fee schedule) or have counsel file
- [ ] Submit application via USPTO Patent Center (or EFS-Web) as a provisional application
- [ ] Save the filing receipt and confirmation number

Detailed steps (US-focused)
1. Prepare documents
- Assemble the provisional description (detailed disclosure), drawings, and inventors' names and addresses. A provisional benefits from clarity and detail — include examples, pseudo-code, and sequence diagrams where helpful.

2. Inventor assignment
- Have inventors sign the assignment and retain executed copies. If assigning to a company, include company signature.

3. Create USPTO account or use counsel
- Go to the USPTO Patent Center and create an account. If you prefer, have a registered patent attorney or agent file on your behalf.

4. Provisional cover sheet & filing
- Prepare the Provisional Application Cover Sheet (PACS) with title, inventor(s), correspondence address, and small entity status if applicable.
- Upload the provisional description (PDF or text), drawings (PDF), and any other attachments.
- Pay the filing fee and submit.

5. After filing
- Record the filing date; a provisional establishes priority for 12 months.
- Within 12 months, decide whether to file a non-provisional patent application claiming priority to the provisional (with formal claims) or file foreign/PCT applications.

Provisional filing tips
- Claims are not required in a provisional, but including informal claims can help describe the boundaries of the invention for drafting a later non-provisional.
- Include as much enabling detail as possible: how to make and use the invention, example data flows, and any implementation-specific details.
- Be careful disclosing public demonstrations before filing if you intend to seek patent protection internationally — public disclosure may bar patenting in some countries.

Estimated fees (US, as of writing — confirm current fees on USPTO site)
- Provisional filing fee: typically a few hundred dollars (reduced for small entities). Check USPTO fee schedule.
- Attorney fees: vary widely; provisional drafting and filing often range from a few hundred to a few thousand USD depending on complexity and counsel.

Next steps & recommendations
- Arrange a short call with a patent attorney to review the draft and claims ideas. They can prepare a stronger provisional and handle filing.
- Perform a professional prior-art/freedom-to-operate search before large investments.
- If you want, I can prepare a prioritized list of claims and a clearer sequence diagram for the invention to hand to counsel.
